 * stack has been suitably initialized, and the task has been entered into its ready queue so that it will run the next time it is scheduled.

 *   tid: the positive integer task id of the newly created task. The task id must be unique, in the sense that no other active task has the same task id.

 *   -2 : kernel is out of task descriptors
